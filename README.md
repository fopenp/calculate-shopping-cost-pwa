# FopenP Calculate Shopping Cost (PWA Edition)

This app makes life easier if you have a credit card (or a gift card) that's close to running out of funds. The credit card balance and the total shopping cost will give you how much you must give to the cashier in cash (and the rest will be withdrawn from the credit card).

For example, if you have $50 in your credit card and you made a $80 shopping, the app will state that you must give $30 cash. The app will round in excess of 50Â¢ whenever appropriate.

There is a "list of transactions" for tracking your balance.

This app is currently available in English and Italian language.
